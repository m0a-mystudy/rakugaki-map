# Security Incident Response Log

## Incident: API Key Exposure (2025-06-28)

### Summary
API keys were accidentally committed to git history during development. This document outlines the response taken and preventive measures implemented.

### Timeline
- **Discovery**: 2025-06-28 - API keys found in git history during security review
- **Response Initiated**: Immediately upon discovery
- **Resolution**: 2025-06-28 - Complete remediation completed

### Exposed Credentials
- ✅ **Google Maps API Key**: `AIzaSyBKWhoeLd9OlcnQVQkWeWF4f3zH8T4gK_w` (INVALIDATED)
- ✅ **Firebase Project Configuration**: Dev environment details (ROTATED)

### Actions Taken

#### Immediate Response
1. ✅ Made repository private
2. ✅ Identified compromised credentials in commits: `3ca0639`, `20fe7b3`, `97c6d45`
3. ✅ Verified current API key is different (new key: `AIzaSyAgo9Sb7B5I5NcvgQTFGxCKTnF0h0HG06c`)
4. ✅ Confirmed old key was already invalidated/regenerated

#### History Cleanup
1. ✅ Created backup tag: `backup-before-history-cleanup`
2. ✅ Used `git-filter-repo` to remove `.env.local` from entire git history
3. ✅ Verified no API keys remain in git history
4. ✅ Force-pushed clean history to GitHub

#### Security Hardening
1. ✅ Verified `.env.local` and `.env.production` in `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Confirmed pre-commit hooks for secret detection are configured
3. ✅ Created secrets baseline for `detect-secrets`
4. ✅ All credentials now stored in Google Secret Manager
5. ✅ Repository using Workload Identity Federation (keyless authentication)

### Current Security Measures

#### Credential Management
- **Google Secret Manager**: All API keys and secrets stored securely
- **Workload Identity Federation**: Keyless CI/CD authentication
- **Environment Variables**: Only fetched from Secret Manager during CI/CD

#### Git Security
- **Pre-commit Hooks**:
  - `detect-secrets` for secret scanning
  - `detect-private-key` for private key detection
  - Custom env file validation script
- **Gitignore**: All environment files excluded
- **History**: Completely clean of any credentials

#### CI/CD Security
- **No GitHub Secrets**: All credentials in Secret Manager
- **Temporary Credentials**: Short-lived tokens via Workload Identity
- **Secure Build Process**: Environment files created at runtime from Secret Manager

### Lessons Learned
1. Never commit environment files with real credentials
2. Use Secret Manager from the start of development
3. Implement pre-commit hooks early
4. Regular security audits of git history
5. Repository should remain private until all security measures are proven

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify no secrets in history
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "aiza\|firebase.*key" | wc -l
# Should return 0

# Verify current API key is valid
terraform output -raw api_key
# Should show current valid key

# Verify secrets in Secret Manager
gcloud secrets list | grep dev
# Should show all required secrets
```

### Incident Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- All compromised credentials invalidated
- New credentials generated and secured
- Git history completely cleaned
- Security measures implemented and verified
- Repository ready for continued development
